# Provide a version of 'pythonrun.c' with PyRun_OpenFile() and

# This is necessary on Windows, as python might be compiled in release mode
# while Slicer is in debug. As python takes a FILE* as function parameter
# like PyRun_File, the FILE* needs to be created with the same STD lib.
# Mixing modes (debug or release) might lead to crashes
